## Business website
### [Live Demo](https://kenshou2.github.io/angular-business-website/)

A small, responsive business website built with **Angular**, **TypeScript**, and **SCSS**, focusing on clean layouts, component-based structure, and maintainable styling.

This project was created to gain hands-on experience with Angular fundamentals and its architectural patterns, while delivering a complete, production-style static website.

## Technologies
- Angular
- TypeScript
- SCSS

## Features
- Responsive page layouts
- Modular, component-based UI
- Clear separation between shared components and page-level features

## Architecture Overview

The project follows Angular’s recommended **component-based architecture**, emphasizing clarity and separation of concerns.

### Core Structure
- **shared** — reusable UI components shared across the application
- **features** — page-level components and routing targets
- **assets** — static assets used throughout the website

This structure keeps the codebase organized, readable, and easy to extend.

## What I Learned
- Core Angular concepts (components, modules, routing)
- Structuring Angular projects for scalability and maintainability
- Styling component-based layouts with SCSS
- Using SVG backgrounds to enhance visual design

## Future Improvements
- Improve accessibility across the application
- Optimize assets and images
- Expand the website with additional pages and interactive features

## Running the project locally
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the Angular development server: `ng serve` if you have Angular installed globally or `npx ng serve` otherwise
4. Open your browser at: `http://localhost:4200`
